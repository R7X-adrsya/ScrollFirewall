# 🛡️ ScrollFirewall

> A smart Android productivity application that limits addictive short-form content consumption by detecting Instagram Reels in real time and automatically minimizing the app after a configurable usage limit.

---

# 📌 Overview

ScrollFirewall is an Android-based digital wellbeing application built using **Java + XML** that helps users reduce excessive scrolling addiction caused by short-form content platforms such as Instagram Reels.

Unlike traditional app blockers, ScrollFirewall uses a **context-aware detection system** that monitors only addictive content sections instead of blocking the entire application.

This allows users to:

* Use Instagram normally
* Send messages
* Browse feed
* Search content

while restricting only:

* Instagram Reels

The application leverages Android’s `AccessibilityService` framework to monitor UI changes and intelligently detect when the user enters a reels-based scrolling environment.

---

# 🚀 Features

## ✅ Context-Aware Reels Detection

* Detects Instagram Reels specifically
* Does NOT block the entire Instagram app
* Normal app usage remains accessible

## ✅ Smart Time Tracking

* Timer starts ONLY inside Reels
* Timer pauses/resets when leaving Reels
* Prevents unnecessary tracking

## ✅ Automatic App Minimization

* Once the usage limit is reached:

  * Instagram is automatically minimized
  * User is redirected to Home screen

## ✅ Re-entry Blocking

* If user reopens Reels after limit:

  * App instantly minimizes again

## ✅ Daily Usage Reset

* Timer resets automatically every day at midnight

## ✅ Lightweight & Efficient

* Debounced accessibility scanning
* Optimized recursive UI traversal
* Minimal battery impact

# 🧠 Problem Statement

Short-form content platforms are designed to maximize user engagement using infinite scrolling algorithms.

Most digital wellbeing apps:

* Block the entire application
* Interrupt productive usage
* Provide poor contextual awareness

ScrollFirewall solves this by targeting only addictive scrolling sections while preserving normal application functionality.

# 🔍 Core Working Principle

## 1️⃣ Accessibility Monitoring

The app continuously listens for:

* `TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED`
* `TYPE_WINDOW_CONTENT_CHANGED`

events from Android Accessibility APIs.

---

## 2️⃣ Reels Detection Engine

The detection engine recursively scans the UI hierarchy using:

* Text matching
* Content descriptions
* UI structure analysis

The detector identifies whether the active screen is:

* Instagram Reels
* or normal Instagram usage

---

## 3️⃣ Session Tracking

When Reels is detected:

* Timer starts/resumes

When user exits Reels:

* Timer pauses/resets

---

## 4️⃣ Enforcement

After reaching the configured limit:

* App triggers:

```java
performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_HOME);
```

which minimizes Instagram instantly.

---

# 🔒 Permissions Used

## Accessibility Service

Required for:

* UI monitoring
* Reels detection
* Enforcement actions

---

# 📱 Application Workflow

```text
User opens Instagram
        ↓
User enters Reels
        ↓
Reels detected
        ↓
Timer starts
        ↓
Usage limit reached
        ↓
Instagram minimized
        ↓
Re-entry attempt blocked
```

---

# 🧪 Detection Logic

## Reels Detection Signals

The app uses:

* Content descriptions
* UI hierarchy patterns
* Recursive accessibility node scanning

---

# ⚡ Performance Optimization

To avoid:

* Battery drain
* Excessive event processing

the app implements:

* Debouncing
* Minimal recursive traversal
* Lightweight event filtering

---

# 🔄 Daily Reset Mechanism

The timer resets automatically every midnight using:

* `Calendar`
* `SharedPreferences`
* timestamp validation
